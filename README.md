## Pinterest Clone: 'Pinteresting'

### Inspired by McKenzie Child with some important distinguishing features:
- Rails 5 != Rails 4
- ERB != Slim
- Carrierwave != Paperclip
- Cloudinary integration (including image caching)
- Visible pin creation date
- Customised Bootstrap Styling ('cause I'm crazy like that)

### Steps
- bundle install
- rails db:migrate
- User will need to upload their cloudinary.yml file and place inside config folder

### Current project is still in progress
#### To do list
- Once a user deletes their account, delete their images
- Configure gem 'jquery-turbolinks' (Not currently supporting Rails 5)
- ?
- Make a million dollars
- Deploy to Heroku
